            <p class="hptitle">Although it was tough to choose, HZ came out on top regarding what study and what school to choose. I was interested in numerous topics which for the most part were unrelated. I had to choose between Statistics, Behaviourism and ofcourse, ICT. 
            <br> 
            <br>I simply went along my options, and scratched them from my list one by one. The reason I didn't choose to study Behaviourism or Statistics was that I wanted to do both studies abroad, which was tough because of my age. I ended up deciding to study ICT and at least complete the propaedeutic year. After that I'll be deciding whether I want to continue studying ICT or start a different study, either in the Netherlands or abroad.
            <br>
            <br>What fascinates me about ICT is how the world depends on it. Whatever you may think of, it's related to ICT. We're helpless without it- we depend on it, yet the majority of people, including myself, don't know how it actually works, which is why I wanted to learn more.
            <br>
            <br>A contributing factor to choosing the HZ is the fact that my elder sister attended this school. A positive experience from an authority combined with my own experience (Open days and the student-for-a-day event) made for the decision to attend the HZ.
