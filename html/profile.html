        <h2 class="proftitle">My Profile</h2>
        <p>So, the name's Ralph, with my last name literally being my nationality: Dutch. I recently turned 16, and decided to study ICT after finishing High School. I've got one thing that can always entertain me: video games. Not really a surprise: male, studying ICT. Games will always be my comfort area, the place where I can truly show myself. Most people who played games with me, whether it was casual or competitive, will know this about me:</p>
      <br>
        <ul class="confidence">
        <li>Competitive</li>
        <br>
        <li>Over-competitive</li>
        <br>
        <li>Can't "enjoy" a casual game</li>
        </ul>
        <br> <br> <br>
        <p>Well... I guess there's a reason for this. If I do something, can be a game, can be something completely different, it's my natural instinct to try and win. I try and set myself up for the best possible outcome, and will lead anyone who's willing to follow me and help me. It's not even winning that makes me do it, it's about knowing that I can always improve on things, even if I performed above my own standards. </p>
        <br>
        <img class="val" src="resources/val2-removebg-preview.png" alt="Valorant Logo">
        <p>This competitive edge of mine made for me to climb the ranks in Valorant, eventually ending up with a job as a coach for a tier 2 team, where I assisted in improving the team as a whole, but at the same time focussing on the individual skills of the team, setting them up for what I hoped for was victory. Although we did win some matches and smaller tournaments, the team disbanded as funds were running low. I hope to someday continue in this field, seeing as I enjoyed it more than anything I've ever done. </p>
        <br> <br>
        <p>The tricky thing with this is however, that I sometimes can be somewhat of an un-enjoyable person to be around with. I'm glad I have friends who somewhat think the same, but at the same time remind me that not everything has to be about trying your best, let alone winning.</p>
        <br> <br>
        <p>No but in all seriousness, in my everyday I'm usually </p><br>
        <ul>
          <div class="me">
           <li>A tad quiet</li><br>
           <li>Introverted, although loving a good (deep?) conversation with someone at times</li><br>
           <li>In the mood for some good food</li><br>
           <li>In for a nice brain-exercise</li><br>
           <li>Down to play some games with friends</li><br>
        </ul>
        <br> <br>
      </div>
        <p>When I'm off school, I work as a bartender at a local restaurant. Although the shifts are quite long, it's well-paying (for my age) and the work environment is more than I could've ever wished for in a parttime job. </p><br><br>
