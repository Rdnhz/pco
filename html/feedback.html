      <p class="blogp">When reading the feedback I received on my "Who am I" document, I instantly realised I hadn't been clear enough. I'd say something then continue somewhere else about it yet not give a definitive answer. This is mostly regarding the motivation for this choice of study. Although explained on the <a href="index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homepage</a>, I will walk through it again.</p><br><br>
      <p class="blogp">I had interest in three studies: Behaviourism, Statistics and ICT. Even though I liked all of them, ICT was a bit higher on my list seeing as my sister attended the HZ. This wasn't however my motivation. I felt like I wanted to know more what's behind the things that run todays society. We're done for without technology, so why not get to know it better?</p><br><br>
      <p class="blogp">I was advised to obtain some information regarding the data-science path during the PCO, which I did. Although I obviously don't have a clear preference yet, it does sound interesting. I'll have to figure whether I like it more than Software Engineering and Business IT Consultancy, but that's all to come.</p><br><br>
      <p class="blogp">Earlier, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to balance my free time and my time spent on assignments, and the feedback told me to try and think of a way to be able to do this. From just the first week and a half I learnt that if you follow the self-study assignments, you'll be well on your way to completing the assignment. This in itself showed me that, as long as I stay up to date, there's nothing to worry about.</p>
